    // In this example data is saved to the window.users variable
    // So it's available for use anywhere in the app/page
    function successFunc(data) {
      window.users = data;
    }

    // Use Sheetsu.read to get data from a spreadsheet.
    // Pass callback function, which takes one argument - data
    // It's triggered after getting data from API
    Sheetsu.read("https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/020b2c0f/", {}, successFunc);
  </script>
</body>
```

# What is Sheetsu

[Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com) is a connection between you and Google Spreadsheets, you can use **anywhere** on the web. You don't need to worry about authorization, refreshing tokens. You just speak with Google Spreadsheets, the easy language you know.

[Go to Sheetsu website &rarr;](https://sheetsu.com)

# How to create Google Spreadsheets API?
### 1. Create a new Google Spreadsheets file
Open your browser and go to the [Google Spreadsheets site](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/). Create a new spreadsheet by clicking the "+" button. We will read data from this spreadsheet.

![Go to Google Spreadsheets](images/step-1-1.png)

Name your new spreadsheet.

![Name spreadsheet](images/step-1-2.png)

I named it "Example". Then add an example data. [You can copy them from this doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fW0JSTn2Jc3NkfuUkAn9aa_8kq-BqGVFOjp8lHzP8rc/edit#gid=0). Remember about naming columns first.

![Example data](images/step-1-3.png)

### 2. Go to Sheetsu.com and sign up
When spreadsheet part is done, you need to [Sign up to Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com). [Let's go to Sheetsu main page](https://sheetsu.com) and click "SIGN UP" button in top-right corner of the website.

![Sign up to Sheetsu](images/step-2-1.png)

Sheetsu is using Google Authorization system, so you will be redirected to Google accounts page to give some permissions.

![Accept Google permissions](images/step-2-2.png)

If you accept them, click ALLOW button.
And puff! It is done! We are on the dashboard.

### 3. Copy API URL from Sheetsu
To create an API you need to go back to your previously created spreadsheet and copy its URL.

![Copy Google Spreadsheets URL](images/step-3-1.png)

And the last thing to do is to paste this URL in your dashboard and click "CREATE API" button.

![Create API](images/step-3-2.png)

After that, your Sheetsu API will be created. You can click on a generatated link and see the results:

## Docs

[Sheetsu documentation sits on GitHub](https://github.com/sheetsu/docs). We would love your contributions! We want to make these docs accessible and easy to understand for everyone. Please send us Pull Requests or open issues on GitHub.

### Sheetsu.read(url, options, callback)
Read data from Google Spreadsheet. Runs `callback` on success. `options` can be:
```
limit - number of how many rows should be returned
offset - number from which row response should start (default is 0)
transposed - transpose sheet on the fly. Default is false
sheet - name of worksheet you want to access. Also, can be a number, worksheet sare numbered from 0.
        Example:
        { sheet: "Sheet2" } - read data from worksheet named 'Sheet2'
        { sheet: 3 } - read data from fourth worksheet
search - object with search params to match searching criteria. Accepts '*' as a wildcard.
         Example:
         { search: { name: "Peter", score: 42 } } - return rows where name == Peter and score == 42
         { search: { name: "*is" } } - return rows where name ends with 'is'

All options can be used together
{ sheet: "Sheet2", search: { foo: "bar" }, limit: 1 } - return first row only from worksheet named "Sheet2", where column 'foo' equals 'bar'
```

### Sheetsu.write(url, data, options, callback)
Write data to Google Spreadsheet. Runs `callback` with sent data on success. `data` can be object - one row, or array similar to
```
{
  rows: [
    { name: "X", score: "1" },
    { name: "Y", score: "2" }
  ]
}
```
if you want to save more than one row in a single request.
`options` can be:
```
sheet - name of worksheet you want to access. Also, can be a number, worksheet sare numbered from 0.
        Example:
        { sheet: "Sheet2" } - read data from worksheet named 'Sheet2'
        { sheet: 3 } - read data from fourth worksheet
```

# Development

To test this library open `SpecRunner.html` in a web browser. All specs are written with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). Please keep in mind to keep this code as small as possible and to work on any kind of browser (yes, even old IE...).

Run all tests:
```bash
$ open `SpecRunner.html`
```
